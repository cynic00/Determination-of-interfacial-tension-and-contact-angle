# Determination of interfacial tension and contact angle using computer vision for oil feld applications

Contact angle and surface tension are the two most widely used surface analysis approaches for reservoir fuid characterization in petroleum industries. The pendant drop method has among the most widely used techniques for the estimation of surface tension. The present work utilizes a python-based computer program to automatically determine interfacial tension (IFT) and contact angle from the pendant drop image acquired from a typical pendant drop apparatus. The proposed program uses python-based image processing libraries for the analysis of the pendant drop image. Also, the program is tested on images acquired from the standard solutions for the IFT and contact angle calculation showing promising results with a standard deviation of less than 1.7 mN/m.
